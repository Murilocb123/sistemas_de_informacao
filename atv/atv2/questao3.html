        <h2>What is Lorem Ipsum?</h2>
        <p><strong><a href="https://www.lipsum.com/" target="_blank">Lorem Ipsum</a></strong> is simply dummy text of the printing and <a href="https://www.lipsum.com/" target="_blank">typesetting</a> industry. 
            <i><a href="https://www.lipsum.com/" target="_blank">Lorem Ipsum</a></i> has been the <i>industry's</i> standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, 
            when an unknown printer took a <i>galley</i> of type and <b>scrambled</b> it to make a type specimen book. 
            It has <u>survived</u> not only five centuries, but also the </b>leap into</b> electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. 
            It was <u>popularised</u> in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages,
             and more <span style="color: red;">recently</span> with <span style="color: green;">desktop</span> <span style="color: blue;">publishing</span> <span style="color: yellow;">softwarez</span> like Aldus PageMaker <span style="color: violet;">including</span> versions of <a href="https://www.lipsum.com/" target="_blank"><b>Lorem Ipsum.</b></a></p>
